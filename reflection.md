The goal of this programming assignment was to create a three player sticks game. Two players and a computer
In this game, the player left with only one stick remaining was the loser of the game.
I just ensured that I was using all the Python functions I needed for this program and that they were properly running when I used them in my code for this game that I created. 
The key concepts that were explored in this programming assignment was getting better at using while loops, if statements,condition statements, using definitions, for loops, and while continuing on building on other basic code.
Yes, the results had matched the expected outcome and follows the algorithm created for this project. 
In addition, I just ran the program multiple times within Pycharm to ensure that the program ran smoothly.
The challenges I encountered was just making sure that the code would run smoothly without running into any error that would allow for the program not to run properly. 
I ensured that I followed the 3 rules of programming by first listing the problem from the user, how we plan to solve, and then created an algorithm, so that we could create the user’s desired program. 
Furthermore, I overcame my problems by having Professor Z provide feedback on my algorithm to make sure that it was proper and that I wasn’t missing anything in order for this program I needed to create would run smoothly. 
I think that I learned what I was supposed to take away from this lab. 
On one hand it’s nice working alone because you don’t need to rely on anyone else but on the other hand its quicker to create programs and go through all the steps when you have another mind and set of hands to help you do all the work.
